<u><h2>Introduction to IOT</h2></u>
<p>
<h3>Internet of Things is a system of devices connected to the Internet with the ability to collect and exchange data from users or environment with no human intervention.</h3>
</p>
<p>
<h3>The device or the 'Things' in IOT could be any device embedded with electronics, software and sensor like a smart refrigerator, a smart air conditioner,lights in household,connected security system or even a person with a heart monitor or an automobile.</h3>

<p>
<u><h2>Why IOT?</h2></u>
</P>
<h3><ul>we are lazy.</ul></h3>
<h3><ul>we want to automate everything.</ul></h3>
<h3><ul>we want to control everything remotely.</ul></h3>
<h3><ul>we want to see data in real time.</ul></h3>
<p>
<u><h2>Little History</h2></u>
</p>
<h3><ul>IOT was originated in the late 1990's when the concept of connecting everyday object to the internet was introduced.</ul></h3>
<h3><ul>The term "Internet of Things" was conined by Kelvin Ashton in 1999.</ul></h3>
<h3><ul>Early IOT devices, like a toaster that could be controlled remotely, showcasted the potential of IOT.</ul></h3>

<img src="C:\Users\Haha CORPORATION\Desktop\pranisha\Applications.png"width="1300"height="800">
<h3><li>Building and Home Automation</li></h3>
<h3><li>Smart Manufacturing </li></h3>
<h3><li>Medical and healthcare systems</li></h3>
<h3><li>Smart Transportation</li></h3>
<h3><li>Energy resource management</li></h3>

</p>
<h3><li>Ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device;</li></h3>
<h3><li>Improved communication between connected electronics devices;</li></h3>
<h3><li>Transferring data packets over a connected network saving time and money;</li></h3>
<h3><li>Automating tasks helping to improve the quality of a business's services and reducing the need  for human intervention.</li></h3>

<h3><li>As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between  devices,the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information increases.</li></h3>
<h3><li>If there's a bug in the system, it's likely that every connected device will become  corrupted.</li></h3>
<h3><li>Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers--maybe even millions--of IOT  devices, and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.</li></h3>
<h3><li>Since there's no international standard of compatability for IOT, it's difficult for devices from manufactures to commtnicate with each others.</li> </h3>      
</p>
<p>
<u><h2>Examples of IOT</h2></u>
</p>
<h3><li>Imagine a smart traffic camera:The camera can monitor the road for congestion,accident and weather conditions and communicate that's data to a gateway that combines it with data from other such cameras creating an intelligent citywide traffic system.</li></h3>
<h3><li>A lightbulb that can be switched on using a smartphone app is an IOT device, as is a motion sensor or a smart thermostant in your office or a connected streetlight.</li></h3>
<h3><li>An IOT device could be as fluffy as a child's toy or as serious as a driverless truck.</li></h3>
<h3><li>Some large object may themselves be filled with many smaller IOT components, stch as a jet engine that's now filled with thousands of sensors collecting and transmitrting data back to make sure it operating effciently.</li></h3>  
</p>
<p>
<u><h2>Challanges of IOT</h2></u>
</P>
<h3><li>Sensing a complex environment:Innovative ways to sense and deliver information from physical world to the cloud.</h3></li>
<h3><li>Connectivity:Variety of wired and wireless standards are required to enable different application needs.</h3></li>
<h3><li>Power:Many IOT applications need to run for years over battery and reduce the overall energy consumption.</h3></li>
<h3><li>Security:Protecting user's privacy, manufacturer's Ip and blocking malicious activity.</h3></li>
<h3><li>Compliexity:IOT application development needs to be easy for all developers not just to experts.</h3></li>
<h3><li>Cloud:IOT application require end-to-end solutions including cloud services.</h3></li> 
<p>
<u><h2>Conclusion</h2></u>
</p>
<h3><li>The IOT must be seen as a vision where "things",especially everyday objects like home appliances,furniture,vehicles,roads,and smart materials.</h3></li>
<h3><li>This vision will surely change with time,especially as synergies between Identification Technologies,Wireless Sensor Networks,Intelligent Devices and Nanotechnology will enable a number of advanced applications and societal benefits.</h3></li>
<h3><li>The Internet will continue to go through many transformations.</h3></li>
